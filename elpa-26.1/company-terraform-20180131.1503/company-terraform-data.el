If given host number is negative, the count starts from the end of the range. For example, cidrhost(\"10.0.0.0/8\", 2) returns 10.0.0.2 and cidrhost(\"10.0.0.0/8\", -2) returns 10.255.255.254.")

For example, cidrnetmask(\"10.0.0.0/8\") returns 255.0.0.0. Not applicable to IPv6 networks since CIDR notation is the only valid notation for IPv6.")
    ("cidrsubnet" "cidrsubnet(iprange, newbits, netnum) - Takes an IP address range in CIDR notation (like 10.0.0.0/8) and extends its prefix to include an additional subnet number. For example, cidrsubnet(\"10.0.0.0/8\", 8, 2) returns 10.2.0.0/16; cidrsubnet(\"2607:f298:6051:516c::/64\", 8, 2) returns 2607:f298:6051:516c:200::/72.")

    ("element" "element(list, index) - Returns a single element from a list   at the given index. If the index is greater than the number of   elements, this function will wrap using a standard mod algorithm.   This function only works on flat lists. Examples:  element(aws_subnet.foo.*.id, count.index)  element(var.list_of_strings, 2)")
    ("file" "file(path) - Reads the contents of a file into the string. Variables   in this file are not interpolated. The contents of the file are   read as-is. The path is interpreted relative to the working directory.   Path variables can be used to reference paths relative   to other base locations. For example, when using file() from inside a   module, you generally want to make the path relative to the module base,   like this: file(\"${path.module}/file\").")
    ("floor" "floor(float) - Returns the greatest integer value less than or equal to   the argument.")
    ("format" "format(format, args, ...) - Formats a string according to the given   format. The syntax for the format is standard sprintf syntax.   Good documentation for the syntax can be found here.   Example to zero-prefix a count, used commonly for naming servers:   format(\"web-%03d\", count.index + 1).")
    ("formatlist" "formatlist(format, args, ...) - Formats each element of a list   according to the given format, similarly to format, and returns a list.   Non-list arguments are repeated for each list element.   For example, to convert a list of DNS addresses to a list of URLs, you might use:   formatlist(\"https://%s:%s/\", aws_instance.foo.*.public_dns, var.port).   If multiple args are lists, and they have the same number of elements, then the formatting is applied to the elements of the lists in parallel.   Example:   formatlist(\"instance %v has private ip %v\", aws_instance.foo.*.id, aws_instance.foo.*.private_ip).   Passing lists with different lengths to formatlist results in an error.")

    ("log" "log(x, base) - Returns the logarithm of x.")
    ("lookup" "lookup(map, key, [default]) - Performs a dynamic lookup into a map   variable. The map parameter should be another variable, such   as var.amis. If key does not exist in map, the interpolation will   fail unless you specify a third argument, default, which should be a   string value to return if no key is found in map. This function   only works on flat maps and will return an error for maps that   include nested lists or maps.")
    ("lower" "lower(string) - Returns a copy of the string with all Unicode letters mapped to their lower case.")
    ("map" "map(key, value, ...) - Returns a map consisting of the key/value pairs specified as arguments. Every odd argument must be a string key, and every even argument must have the same type as the other values specified. Duplicate keys are not allowed. Examples:  map(\"hello\", \"world\")  map(\"us-east\", list(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"), \"us-west\", list(\"b\", \"c\", \"d\"))")
    ("matchkeys" "matchkeys(values, keys, searchset) - For two lists values and keys of   equal length, returns all elements from values where the corresponding   element from keys exists in the searchset list.  E.g.   matchkeys(aws_instance.example.*.id,   aws_instance.example.*.availability_zone, list(\"us-west-2a\")) will return a   list of the instance IDs of the aws_instance.example instances in   \"us-west-2a\". No match will result in empty list. Items of keys are   processed sequentially, so the order of returned values is preserved.")
    ("max" "max(float1, float2, ...) - Returns the largest of the floats.")
    ("merge" "merge(map1, map2, ...) - Returns the union of 2 or more maps. The maps are consumed in the order provided, and duplicate keys overwrite previous entries.  ${merge(map(\"a\", \"b\"), map(\"c\", \"d\"))} returns {\"a\": \"b\", \"c\": \"d\"}")
    ("min" "min(float1, float2, ...) - Returns the smallest of the floats.")

    ("replace" "replace(string, search, replace) - Does a search and replace on the   given string. All instances of search are replaced with the value   of replace. If search is wrapped in forward slashes, it is treated   as a regular expression. If using a regular expression, replace   can reference subcaptures in the regular expression by using $n where   n is the index or name of the subcapture. If using a regular expression,   the syntax conforms to the re2 regular expression syntax.")

    ("signum" "signum(int) - Returns -1 for negative numbers, 0 for 0 and 1 for positive numbers.   This function is useful when you need to set a value for the first resource and   a different value for the rest of the resources.   Example: element(split(\",\", var.r53_failover_policy), signum(count.index))   where the 0th index points to PRIMARY and 1st to FAILOVER")

    ("sort" "sort(list) - Returns a lexographically sorted list of the strings contained in   the list passed as an argument. Sort may only be used with lists which contain only   strings.   Examples: sort(aws_instance.foo.*.id), sort(var.list_of_strings)")
    ("split" "split(delim, string) - Splits the string previously created by join   back into a list. This is useful for pushing lists through module   outputs since they currently only support string values. Depending on the   use, the string this is being performed within may need to be wrapped   in brackets to indicate that the output is actually a list, e.g.   a_resource_param = [\"${split(\",\", var.CSV_STRING)}\"].   Example: split(\",\", module.amod.server_ids)")
    ("substr" "substr(string, offset, length) - Extracts a substring from the input string. A negative offset is interpreted as being equivalent to a positive offset measured backwards from the end of the string. A length of -1 is interpreted as meaning \"until the end of the string\".")
    ("timestamp" "timestamp() - Returns a UTC timestamp string in RFC 3339 format. This string will change with every invocation of the function, so in order to prevent diffs on every plan & apply, it must be used with the ignore_changes lifecycle attribute.")
    ("title" "title(string) - Returns a copy of the string with the first characters of all the words capitalized.")
    ("trimspace" "trimspace(string) - Returns a copy of the string with all leading and trailing white spaces removed.")
    ("upper" "upper(string) - Returns a copy of the string with all Unicode letters mapped to their upper case.")

    ("zipmap" "zipmap(list, list) - Creates a map from a list of keys and a list of   values. The keys must all be of type string, and the length of the lists   must be the same.   For example, to output a mapping of AWS IAM user names to the fingerprint   of the key used to encrypt their initial password, you might use:   zipmap(aws_iam_user.users.*.name, aws_iam_user_login_profile.users.*.key_fingerprint).")
